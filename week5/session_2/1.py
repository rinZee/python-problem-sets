#Problem 1: Battle Pokemon
#Given the Pokemon class below, copy the code and add it to your Replit.

class Pokemon():
	def  __init__(self, name, hp, damage):
		self.name = name
		self.hp = hp # hit points
		self.damage = damage # The amount of damage this pokemon does to its opponent every attack
		
	def attack(self, opponent):
		if opponent.hp - self.damage <= 0:
			opponent.hp = 0
			print(f"{opponent} fainted")
			
		else:
			print(f"{self.name} dealt {self.damage} damage to {opponent.name}")
			opponent.hp = opponent.hp - self.damage
			print(opponent.hp)
		
#Then, write a method attack() that takes in a Pokemon object opponent and decreases opponent's hp by their self's damage amount.

#If damaging the opponent leads to the opponent having an hp of 0 or less, the function should set the opponent's hp to 0 and
#  print out "<Opponent name> fainted>.

#Otherwise, the function should print out "<Pokemon name> dealt <damage> damage to <opponent name>".

#Example Usage:

pikachu = Pokemon("Pikachu", 35, 20)
bulbasaur = Pokemon("Bulbasaur", 45, 30) 

opponent = bulbasaur
pikachu.attack(opponent)
#Example Output: "Pikachu dealt 20 damage to Bulbasaur"
