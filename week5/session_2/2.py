#Problem 2: Convert to Linked List
#A linked list is a new data type that, similar to a normal list or array, allows us to store pieces of data sequentially. 
# The difference between a linked list and a normal list lies in how each element is stored in a computer’s memory.

#In a normal list, individual elements of the list are stored in adjacent memory locations according to the order 
#they appear in the list. If we know where the first element of the list is stored, 
# it’s really easy to find any other element in the list.

#In a linked list, the individual elements called nodes are not stored in sequential memory locations.
#  Each node may be stored in an unrelated memory location. To connect nodes together into a sequential list, 
# each node stores a reference or pointer to the next node in the list.

#Using the provided Node class below, create the normal Python list ["Jigglypuff", "Wigglytuff"] as a linked list.

class Node:
	def __init__(self, value, next=None):
		self.value = value
		self.next = next
#Example Usage (after completing the problem with variable names node_1 and node_2):

node_1 = Node ('Jigglypuff')
node_2 = Node ('Wigglypuff')

node_1.next = node_2

print(node_1.value, "->", node_1.next.value)
print(node_2.value, "->", node_2.next)
#xample Output:

#Jigglypuff -> Wigglytuff
#Wigglytuff -> None
#Result Linked list: Jigglypuff -> Wigglytuff
