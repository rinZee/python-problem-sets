Problem 9: Doubly Linked List
One of the drawbacks of a linked list is that it's difficult to go backwards, because each Node only knows about the Node in front of it. (E.g., A -> B -> C)

A doubly linked list solves this problem! Instead of just having a next attribute, a doubly linked list also has a prev attribute that points to the Node before it. (E.g., A <-> B <-> C)

Given the Node class for a doubly linked list below, recreate the list ["Poliwag", "Poliwhirl", "Poliwrath"] as a doubly linked list.

class Node:
	def __init__(self, value, next = None, prev = None):
		self.value = value
		self.next = next
		self.prev = prev
Example Usage: (after completing the problem with variable names poliwag, poliwhirl, and poliwrath):

print(poliwhirl.prev.value, "<->", poliwhirl.value, "<->", poliwhirl.next.value)
Example Output:

'Poliwag' <-> 'Poliwhirl' <-> 'Poliwrath'`
